# `workerOPFS`: High-Performance Web Worker File System

> **`workerOPFS`** is a JavaScript library built for performance-critical applications running exclusively within **Web Workers**. It provides a robust, senior-engineer-designed abstraction layer over the browser's native **Origin Private File System (OPFS)**, prioritizing synchronous I/O, lazy execution, and intelligent data caching for maximum speed and efficiency.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

* **‚ö° High-Speed I/O:** Leverages the **Synchronous Access Handle** for the fastest possible byte-level read/write operations within a Web Worker.
* **üß† Lazy Execution & Caching:** Properties (like `.bytes`, `.exists`, `.sha256`) are lazy-loaded on first access and cached, making repeated metadata checks instantaneous.
* **üîó SharedArrayBuffer Support:** Dedicated methods for zero-copy data transfer between the file system and inter-worker communication channels.
* **üß± Modular & Maintainable:** Built entirely on plain JavaScript and native browser APIs, promoting a clean, extensible codebase without external dependencies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Since this library is designed for the Web Worker environment, it must be imported using standard ES Modules syntax within your Worker script.

### Installation (Conceptual)

This is an in-house library. Ensure the source files (`index.js`, `opfsWorkerFile.js`, etc.) are available to your Worker script.

### Usage Example (in `worker.js`)

```javascript
// worker.js
import { OPFSWorkerFile, OPFSWorkerDirectory } from './index.js';

async function processFile(filePath) {
    const file = new OPFSWorkerFile(filePath); // SYNCHRONOUS instantiation

    if (!(await file.exists)) {
        const dir = await file.parentDir;
        console.log(`Parent directory exists: ${await dir.exists}`);
        
        // Write data, which implicitly creates the file and necessary directories
        const data = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello FANG!');
        await file.writeBytes(data, 0);
    }
    
    // Read cached properties (instant access after first fetch)
    console.log(`File Size: ${await file.bytesH} (${await file.bytes} bytes)`);

    // Use high-performance batch update
    await file.update(handle => {
        // Direct, synchronous file system calls here
        handle.truncate(0); 
    });
}

processFile('/user/data/logs/startup.log');
```
